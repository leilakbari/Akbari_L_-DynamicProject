# My Porfolio
Welcome to my portfolio repository! This portfolio showcases my projects and case studies in a user-friendly and dynamic manner using PHP and MySQL. Feel free to explore and get to know more about my work.

# Features
Dynamic Projects Page: The projects page dynamically fetches project information from the MySQL database using PHP PDO-style queries.
Case Study Details: Each project has a detailed case study page that also retrieves content from the database dynamically.

# How to use
Import the SQL file provided into your MySQL database.
Ensure that you have PHP and a local server environment set up on your machine.
After you opened my portfolio page go to Projects and by clicking on each project you can see more details and pictures related to them.
